# CovidTracking
COVID-19 tracking system made for my bachelor thesis

This is the repository for my Bachelor thesis project.

There are three main parts to this repository : The application, the website, and the card reader.

All three contain the code written for their functionalities.

Please note that the application code cannot be run directly as it is; Flutter generates huge amounts of files automatically (around 600MB).
Github does not allow such big uploads (at least not with a free account and all in one day).
If the app was to be compiled from the sources here, one would need to create a new Flutter project and place these source files in the new project.
